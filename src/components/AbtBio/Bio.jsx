        Hello, my name is Ashley Ikeh and I am a soon-to-be certified software
        developer. It's nice to meet you! I received my Bachelor of Science in
        Psychology from the University of Georgia, where I also studied Korean
        and Sociology.
      </p>

        Prior to becoming a software developer, my work experience ranged from
        interning with the City of Atlanta to working as a receptionist at a
        small veterinary clinic.
      </p>

        After college I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of software
        development, so I chose to study full-stack software development with
        Georgia Institute of Technology. I have developed a solid understanding
        of programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have been
        exposed to libraries like jQuery, Node, and React and have used API's to
        create dynamic websites. Each week I submitted assignments showcasing my
        knowledge of software development. From finding ways to store data to
        learning about sorting algorithms, my coding bootcamp taught me a wide
        range of knowledge I plan to build upon after graduation.
